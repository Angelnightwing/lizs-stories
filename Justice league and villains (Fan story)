A battle raged on in the streets I was dodging every blast and debree as best as I could but I'm to hungery.... I looked as two men was fighting one had a strange power I sniffed the air...Wasn't magic the other looked like a bat the other man covered him in black sand it looked alive than hardend...my ears perked up when they spotted me I ran towards one of the buildings and tried to jump I clawed into it but I was to weak to hold on.... I fell back onto the streets. He tried to cover me in the same black sand but it had no effect I growled and got him off me. "That doesn't work on me...." Everything started spinning than I blacked out...I woke up to loud banging sounds that bat and three others where in a glass...bottle? No one was around so I tried to break it but it just bounced me back....I heard voices coming so I quickly hid around the corner.
