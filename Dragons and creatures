Hey Alexis are you almost ready? (Alexis)"Ya just washing my hair what time is the party?" "Around 9. Where taking my car this time." (Alexis)"I still can't believe your boss invited you to a hard to get into club." "I know glad he let me bring a friend to. I have to warn you though he's pretty hot and protective." (Alexis)"Protective or obsessive?" She chuckled. "Both perhaps but he pays well and takes care of everything." I got out of the shower and dried off. Kate came into the bath room. After we both got changed I got into Kates car Kate got in and turned it on we headed to the club. A guy at the door looked well built but something about him looked off... We got parked and walked right in. "Kate glad you made it." (Kate)"Hey I like you to meet my best friend Alexis." "A pleasure to meet you." He kissed my hand. "This way why don't you relaxe and have something to drink while we wait for the other's." We came to a table with a man already sitting down with two girls on each side he looked up and dissmissed the girls so we could sit. "This is Damien he owns this club." (Damien)"Hello." (Alexis)"Hi." We drank and talked while we drank I noticed another man that just came in. He had dark blue eyes he had the same posture as the other two but his scent was different. "Hope I'm not late." Kates boss shook his head. "Not at all. Kate Alexis meet Drake. I waved while drinking my favorit drink. (Drake)"A pleasure." Kate giggled. (Kate)"Don't mind Alexis shes been working to much." (Alexis)"I thought we wherent going to discuss work?" Kate shrugged and smiled.
