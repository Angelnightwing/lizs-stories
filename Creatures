You always hear story's about being attacked at night time but last night one of our class mate was litterly attacked though she survived and placed in the hospital they said she'll be okay with a phew days worth of rest but who would be okay when they where just attacked. Ever since vampires and other creatures have been made public they've been trying to make a fair system... "Hey Alexis your up any ideas for club projects?" I looked up at the board and saw what was already writtin... (Alexis)"Well I think the ghost hunt is cool and all but we won't be able to stay after dark you know..." The vice presadent chuckled. "Not true I got permission from the teacher as long as we have a teacher willing to stay with us that is." (Alexis)"Okay so what would we be searching for?" "I heard theirs been more activitys in the class rooms." "Ya their been getting pretty scarey they wanted us to look into it." (Alexis)"What does the presadent think we should do?" (Vice presadent)"He said we should at least look into it but their are other things that need attention to." She looked worried. (Alexis)"We can split it up and check in groups and who ever finishes can help the others." "sounds good." "Ya." (Vice presadent)"Great I'll go tell the teacher." (Alexis)"Don't forget to get permission to remove these just incase it get bad." She nodded. power limiters help but not when we need to defend ourselves dragons and vampires and such are S class cases that usaly have a licence to use our gifts on campus or off campus
