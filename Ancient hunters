We where out hunting vampires that went rogue killing their own...we entered a town it was covered in snow... I rolled down the window. "Watch out vampire..." I looked he was feeding on a bench not really paying attention but the vampires we where hunting his in a nearby store.... splitting up I jumped out of the truck while the others went on ahead I kept getting this bad feeling like we entered someones territory.... I got jumped as soon as I entered.... "Let me go!" "Its pay back for breaking my brothers nose..." All of a sudden it got really cold two ice wolves appeared behind them was a man...His hair was long and white his eyes looked icy blue... "Hey whats your problem?" One walked up to the man the wolves growled than they ran passed the vampire and attacked the others behind as the man swiftly jabbed his hand into the vampire but instead of burning he started to freeze... I stood their in a daze while the man walked up to me he curresed my cheek it felt cold as ice...He tilted my head revealing my neck fangs grew I felt a sharp prick...he's inside draining my blood his thoughts entered my mind...I started to feel light headed when one of the vampires attacked the man and I was able to get away I changed into a huge white wolf to find the others leaving a trail of blood...Everyone was at a huge fountain it looks like they trapped another group...before I got there I changed back. "Did you find their leader?" I shook my head. "We have bigger problems...I think where in a powerful vampires territory...
