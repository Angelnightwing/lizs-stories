We where out hunting vampires that went rogue killing their own...we entered a town it was covered in snow... I rolled down the window. "Watch out vampire..." I looked he was feeding on a bench not really paying attention but the vampires we where hunting his in a nearby store.... splitting up I jumped out of the truck while the others went on ahead I kept getting this bad feeling like we entered someones territory....
