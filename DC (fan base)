Another day In gotham city with sirens and screams and the bat flying around catching bad guys. I gazed down at the city I streched my wings than I jumped flying through the city when something flew past me really fast it knocked me off balance...Was that the bat? Than another flash right past me. "Hey watch it I'm flying here!"Where's the fire?
