My first ball with my best friend Kate well not my first but than again I was only a child. (Kate)" Come on Alexis." (Alexis)"Coming. I forgot how hard it is to walk in these." Kate chuckled. (kate)"Your doing fine besides all the guy's are looking our way." I blushed. Wow it's beautiful. Everyone was entranced by the music I stayed behind Kate as some of the guys came up to talk. I could hear some talking about us. (Kate)"I know you dislike these events but maybe you can give it a chance." (Alexis)"Am I really unapproachable?" She smiled. (Kate)"Relax tonight is our night so let's in joy it." (Alexis)"Your right." The music started and everyone started to dance. I got into it as for my dance partner well was strange his mask looked like well I'm not really sure. But he danced perfectly actually he wasn't the only one wearing that mask the host also wore something similar though his was different. Maybe Kate's right I need to relax.
