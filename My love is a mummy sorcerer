I flew through the desert looking for somewhere to land... I saw what looked like a temple I flew down for a closer look...I spread my wings to glide down it was huge and strange. What is this? I wander what could be here... I landed safely I folded my wings as I entered the huge temple entrance. Wow this place is huge and full of magic. I started to feel sleepy I saw a place to sleep
