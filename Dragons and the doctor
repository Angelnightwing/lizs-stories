Hey what's going on? Intruders stay In your rooms! Roxie how can you be so calm? (Roxie)"Cause I know they won't get far plus we got our little fire breather here." She patted my head I blushed and curled my toes in. All of a sudden men with weapons and mascks barged in. "Don't move!" "Leader their just kids..." He commed the others. I walked up to them. "Are you bad people?" "Hey kid I told you not to move." "What are you going to do with us?" (Everyone behind me...)They slowly gotten behind me and ducked. My mouth smoked as I blew out hot flames I was about  to let loose when the doctor and his men came up from  behind they took them all out. "Good job Rose." Doctor....He patted my head. He whispered in my ears.
