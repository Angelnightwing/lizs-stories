I was cooking when I heard a knock. "Coming!" It was my friend and her friends? "Hey Alexis sorry where late forgot how far you live. (Alexis)"Glad you made it I hope you're hungry." "Want some help?" A man with a dark coat with long black hair. When he smiled I could of sworn I saw fangs. I smiled. (Alexis)"Sure if you don't mind."
