The alarm went off... I woke up from a deep sleep turning off my alarm. New message from mom. I tapped the screen. "Hey my little fire breather I hope you're ready to come home I know I am and Vlad is really looking forward to meeting you." I replied. "Hey mom ya I can't wait ether just woke up "smily face" and send. I got ready. I heard my ride outside ready to take me to the airport. I grabbed my bags and locked the doors. I texted mom. "I'm on my way to the airport see you soon."  We drove to the airport he dropped me off there waiting was a small plane. The pilot helped me put my bags into the plane than we took off and headed for the small town my mom moved to. Apparently it's been around for along time.... I looked out the window I always loved flying father use to tell me how dragons use to rule the land skies and seas. I wish I could of flown with him one more time like we use to....(pilot)"Hey where almost there! Get ready it's going to get bumpy!" I nodded. My caught glimpse of mom and some tall figure next to her must be Vlad. When the plane landed I grabbed my bags and got out no sooner mom hugged me tightly...."Hi mom....can't...breath." She loosened her grip but I felt wet teardrops. (Vladimir)"You're mom has been really missing you." "Alexandra this is Vlad." (Alexandra)"Nice to meet you. " All of a sudden my stomach growled I blushed while rubbing my stomach.  Mom giggled. (Vladimir)"Why don't we go get something to eat? What sounds good?" (Mom)"How about steak." Mm steak. I started to drool just thinking about it. Vlad smiled. (Vlad)"That's a yes." He took my bags and placed them in his car. I sat in the back.  (Mom)"Dear I been meaning to ask how was your time at that school?" (Alexandra)"It was okay I learned a lot of lost languages and we visited an old ruin temple." Vlad looked into the mirror I'm not sure but it looked like he could tell what was going through my thoughts. We stopped for dinner and discussed a lot of things like what I'm going to do and about my room mom also told me about how Vlad has a huge family but they where keeping something from me than again so was I .... after we ate we headed home so I could unpack everything...we arrived at a huge mansion it looked like it's been here for a long time but it's been really taken care of... It looked like someone was waiting at the door. Vlad parked and got out."Welcome home Master and Ma'am
