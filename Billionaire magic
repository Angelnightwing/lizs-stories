My roommate woke me up to the smell of breakfast I got up my hair fell to the floor as I stretched. "Hey Rose I'm having someone over tonight for dinner is that alright?" I pulled up my pants. (Rose)"Sure Emily do you want me to stay out for your date?" (Emily)"It's not a date... It's my boss..." She glared at me. (Rose)"Oh you mean that new sorcerer that got elected?"She nodded nervously. (Emily)"Please can you cook I know you're busy training but you know you're better at cooking." Emily looked pretty desperate even for her I gave in and agreed. (Emily)"Thanks Rose your the best!" Sad part is she's more interested in her work than with men but I guess the suits her.(Rose)"Does he know it's not a date?" She threw a pillow at me of course I stopped it in mid air. (Emily)"Its work related sheesh...ever since he found these relics we've been trying to figure out what they hold.
