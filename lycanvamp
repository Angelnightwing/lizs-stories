My friend and I stumbled upon an abandoned mansion in the forest not to far from our camp. We entered thinking no one lived here boy where we wrong and it seemed the owner wasn't in a pleasent mood to begin with... He rubbed his temple he had silver eye's with long black hair. The men infront though was out for blood... "We should go..." When we backed up slowly the doors slammed shut a man closed the doors and another was behind my friend I looked at the man with the silver eye's for help but...He was smiling I knew than he wasn't going to help us I slammed into the man holding my friend and shoved him into his pals I quickly grabbed my friends hand but he wouldn't move. "Sam whats wrong?Let's go!" I was knocked out in an instant but before I hit the ground I stopped a tail and ears popped out and I grew claws blood lust seaped out I let out a howl that trembled I was a big white wolf with strange marking I quickly went after the ones who where next to my friend than I turned my gaze to the man watching I leaped right for his throat....but he stopped me with a single hand he knocked me out and I changed back. They took us down below and locked us up....I was having a nightmare their was fire and blood...I woke up in a sweat...I looked around for sam but he wasn't here...While no one was around I slipped through the bars
