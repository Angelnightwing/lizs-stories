Mom When did you say the truck would be at our new place? "I think they said the day after tomorrow." Mom looked at me and smiled. "Don't worry I made sure your swords where packed with care.Are you still wearing your gift?" I nodded.it was a choker with a red gem in the middle I got it in the mail just before we moved. I yawned as mom drove into the small village Grandfather invited us to come live with him. I noticed at the edge of the village was a large mansion. "Hey mom who lives at that mansion?" (Mother)"I believe the owner of this village owns that mansion infact your cousin works their if I'm not mistaken." I couldn't look away something...no someone was calling me. I touched the choker  instinktivly. (Mother)"Dear your revealing your form." I snapped out of it.. "Sorry mom I guase I got excited." I chuckled. I breathed slowly and changed back. Mom chuckled. (Mother)"Your just like your father getting excited." "I wish he could of come with us..." (Mother)"I know Alexis I'm sorry but you know he would of come." I sighed and looked out of the window.We arrived at grandfather's istate it was huge their was a massive wooden gate at the entrance and someone was waiting in front mom parked in front since we had to walk in. The man waiting opened my door. (Alexis)"Uh thanks..." (Mother)"Father!" Mom got out of the car and huged him. "Hello to you to daughter of mine." She smiled I'v never seen mom so happy except when she was with dad.I grabbed some of our thing's. "Why don't you to come inside I'm sure your tired from your drive here.
