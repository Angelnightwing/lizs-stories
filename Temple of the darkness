Rawza make sure you take care of those guardians! I stabbed one and took their weapons while still fighting some of them. One of them had a red gem in their chest armor once I took it down I took the gem off of the armor it suddenly appeared on my forehead I felt a sudden dark power than a guardian stepped out and quickly finished off my two famillures this one was different and stronger...I had no choice but to retreat into the shadows the guardian spoke. "So you can hide in the shadows but you won't have any place to hide..."He went to a a bowl with a strange liquid he got caught by another creature from the liquid...He just bit a chunk out of the guardian...I heard a voice inside my head...Power darkness fear. I ran for the other side of the room the beast was looking for me...all of a sudden a creature with a mirror blinded me I flew out of the shadows the gold shuffled beneath me the creature pounced on top of me while I was weakened...his breath smelled like death he smiled as we started to sink into the shadows my mind started to fade... he looked into my eyes...why doesn't it just kill me?
