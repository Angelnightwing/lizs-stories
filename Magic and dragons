Everyone hold your ground! Dark magic entered our school everyone was fighting these dark scorcerers. I was helping where I could but something felt strange I used a defence spell to help everyone was amazed but when I tried to cast a heal spell it started to change I stopped my body felt heavy as I grew more frustrated... I noticed some of our students where effected as well... Whats going on? "Alexis they need you to guard the temple hurry!" (Alexis)"Alright!" I ran towards the temple. This is to slow... I sprouted wings and took off. I saw the gates closing as I slipped through I swiftly turned and threw up a barrior when the door closed... "Alexis!" (Alexis)"Go I got this....!" He could tell I was at my limit but he took off to help everyone escape... The doors where being attacked on the other side all of a sudden the doors shattered but my barrior was still up....Their stood five scorcerers the middle looked like their leader.... You got to be kidding... "So your the one giving us trouble?" I smiled barely holding myself up. He held up a strange orb it was blacker than night I looked closer a black mist was coming out of it...My barrier.... I quickly flew up to avoid it... all of a sudden my barrier shattered and chains wrapped around my ankles I fell to the ground as more chains wrapped around me... "Go you have your orders I'll keep this one here." Stop.... The four ran passed me... "I see your still fighting our master's darkness." Grind while lifting up my chin...my eyes started to change from a gold to crimson red the chains vanished as I kneeled. "Lead me to where those elders keep the artifacts." (Alexis)"Yes." We met up with the others but their path was blocked. "Whats the problem?" "A powerful barrier was placed we cant break it..." I walked up to the door and broke the barrier. The magic knights where waiting on the other side. "We won't let you pass..." "You four take care of them and you come with me." (Alexis)"Yes" "Alexis snap out of it he's our enemy!" The man smiled. "Its useless this girl belongs to our master now as his darkness over powered her will." "Impossible...she was our strongest...." I grind as my body released dark energy than I released a blast right intonthe four scorceres making their magic stronger than we headed pass the knights. We reached another room the head elder was their. "Why are you attacking? What is it your after? If your not going to answer than release Alexis!" "Why should I? Our Master's will is absalute." My body moved on its own... The elder placed a spell under me that made my body heavy. "Forgive me but bare with it." (Give me absalute control dragon!)I became lost as my eyes burned red with furry a burst of darkness came out of me. (Give in!) My body went still than my eyes changed. "Master forgive me for taking so long..." "What did you do to her?" He laughed. "All I did was take over such raw power....she faught but lost to herself. Now begone!" A burst of dark energy struck the elder but when the dust cleared he was gone. "Its pointless to run..." "Master how did he escape?" "He teleported at the last moment.
