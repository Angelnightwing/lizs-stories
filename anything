I yawned as I woke up  surrounded by box's. My phone rang I picked it up. "Hello?" "Hey Alexis are you ready?" (Alexis)"Hey dad. Ya the mover's arent here yet but everythings packed and ready to go." "Alright once they get their I'll wait for you at the docks." (Alexis)"Okay dad see you soon love you." "See you soon baby girl." The phone clicks. I never would of thought I'd be leaving this place...I guase it wasn't long when my dad and his men showed up at my door steps telling me I was his daughter my grandfather used his connections to find me. The moveing truck finally got here so I told them where to go and I headed off on my Raven motorcycle.
