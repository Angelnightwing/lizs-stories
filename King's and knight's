You really like the black knight arnor don't you? I turned around it was the owner of the museum. "I do." He looked over my shoulder. "Amazing that's vary detailed." "Thanks though it's not finished yet. Um I been meaning to ask but isn't their suppose to be other armor's? I mean where's the other knight's and the king's armor?" "Scattered I'm afraid this one was already in my posetion...Why are you interested?" "It may seem wierd but...For some reasion I seem more drawn to it. I can draw anything but this armor is more interesting if that makes sence." "Alexis! Come on the teacher's waiting for us." (Alexis)"Coming!" I grabbed my backpack and headed out. "If you want you can come back." (Alexis)"Really?" He nodded. "Awesome thanks!" I headed off with the other's. When I got home from school I thought about what the meseun owner said I sighed as I picked up my pendent. I really wished he had the kings armor to. I held onto my pendent and started to drift off to sleep. I drept that I was back at the museum I was looking at the black knight I was about to touch it when a dark mist surrounded me I looked down it lead to a doorway I followed to a hallway with armors on both sides, till I got to a room at end was a throne someone was sitting in it and kneeling was the black knight...no way... I got excited my heart was pounding I thought it would leap out of my chest I was so close...the closer I got the more the darkness surrounded me almost like it wanted to swallow me up sane thing to do would be to run right? But I wanted it to. I felt his gaze it made my cheeks red. All of a sudden my phone woke me up.... I mumbled. (Alexis)"Hello?" "Alexis did you fall asleep?" (Alexis)"Kate... yes I did." "I thought so well I called to remind you about our field trip this weekend you know bring your parents to theme park." I forgot... "I thought you would forget so I got your papers you just need two adult chaperone. Or one." (Alexis)"Right thanks Kate..." (Kate)"No problem I'll meet you at that museum you love so much to give you those papers." I blushed thinking about that dream. (Kate)"Alexis okay..." (Alexis)"Okay. Ya see you tomorrow... goodnight." She hung up the call. I yawned. Maybe I just need a shower. I took off my clothes and took off my pendant I hopped into the shower and turned it on. The hot water felt great my heart was still pounding I wrapped my arms around me all I could imagine his gaze. I finished up and got into bed. I closed my eyes but it was hard getting to sleep I felt a breeze I rolled over and opened my eyes...a shadow figure stood at the foot of my bed it sat on my bed I was about to say something but it placed a finger on my lips it got on top of me...his gaze felt familiar. I blinked and it vanished after it kissed me. After that night I did fall asleep and woke up this morning I got dressed and ate breakfast I hurried out the door to meet my friend... (Kate)"Hey Alexis! Geez did you run here?" I was breathing hard but I didn't run... (Alexis)"No... aren't you early?" She gave a cheeky grin. Than she pulled my arm. (Kate)"Come on I want to see inside." (Alexis)"Wait it's not open yet..." She pouted. "Alexis?" Kate's jaw dropped... (Alexis)"I know I'm early but I wanted to stop by that and Kate wanted to meet here." He laughed. "Come inside than." Before I could say anything Kate yanked me inside...he looked across the street than closed the door when he did a barrier was placed on the door. "So what are you to up to?" (Kate)"This weekend we have a school field trip Alexis forgot to sign some papers..." (Alexis)"I don't have parents to come..." "I'm sorry." (Kate)"She can still bring someone..." Someone came from the back. "I left the crest in that empty room...Oh pardon me. "Ahh Damian thanks this is Alexis and Kate." My face felt hot my heart started to pound... (Damian)"A pleasure to meet you." Kate looked at me and giggled. (Kate)"Like wise." She elbowed me. (Alexis)"Nice to meet you as well." (Kate)"Hey would you too want to come to the theme park this weekend?" (Alexis)"Kate!" She closed my mouth. (Damian)"I'm not doing anything what about you Sebastian?" (Sebastian)"No not that I know of. When is it?" (Kate)"Around 9:00 in the morning. She gave them papers. "Just sign your name there." They both did I was smiling. Kate took the papers and placed it in my backpack. (Kate)"Alexis don't you have art class in the morning?" (Alexis)"I totally forgot! Later!" I ran off... (Kate)"She's totally spaced out these days... It was nice meeting you see you!"
"You played me quite well Damian." (Damian)"And you where right about her she reacted to his image...something's stopping his sire from her." (Sebastian)"Yes but who..." (Damian)"How long can you keep that shape?" (Sebastian)"All day if I have to. But I sensed his majesty visited her last night I imagine he sensed her here." (Damian)"She was here?" He nodded. (Sebastian)"Not physically... Doesn't she look like her?" (Damian)"Ya but younger really young..." A dark laughter filled the museum
