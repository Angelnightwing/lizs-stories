You really like the black knight arnor don't you? I turned around it was the owner of the museum. "I do." He looked over my shoulder. "Amazing that's vary detailed." "Thanks though it's not finished yet. Um I been meaning to ask but isn't their suppose to be other armor's? I mean where's the other knight's and the king's armor?" "Scattered I'm afraid this one was already in my posetion...Why are you interested?" "It may seem wierd but...For some reasion I seem more drawn to it. I can draw anything but this armor is more interesting if that makes sence." "Alexis! Come on the teacher's waiting for us." (Alexis)"Coming!" I grabbed my backpack and headed out. "If you want you can come back." (Alexis)"Really?" He nodded. "Awesome thanks!" I headed off with the other's. When I got home from school I thought about what the meseun owner said I sighed as I picked up my pendent. I really wished he had the kings armor to. I held onto my pendent and started to drift off to sleep. I drept that I was back at the museum
