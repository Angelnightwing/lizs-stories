The room was dark and I was in a deep sleep a cool breeze entered my room as the windows flew open a man came into my room and sat on my bed he looked down at me with kind eyes he curessed my cheeks,he than kissed my forhead  than leaving silently as he came. I woke smelling a famillure scent I looked around the room I looked towards the opened windows slowly taking off the covers I got out of bed my silver long hair swept across the bed as I got up. "The moon brings out your bauty my love but you'll caych a cold if you stand their." He wrapped his arms around me.
