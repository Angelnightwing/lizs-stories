Alexis time to wake up. I turned over with my pillow. (Alexis)"Dad it's only saterday..." "I know but I promised I would take you shopping remember." I sat up my long black hair was strung out across my bed my eye's where crimson red and slit. I yawned. Father padded my head before my eye's opened. I opened my eye's dad was smiling. "I know it's going to take time blending in with human's but you know I love you and I wouldn't of made you move like this if it wasn't important." (Alexis)"I know dad it's going to be wierd." "I know school won't start till monday It's a private school the new program is so that we can learn from human's and to co excist with other creatures. Now get ready while I make breakfast." I nodded. Dad went downstair's while I hopped into the shower it felt great I touched my chest...I wander when father will give me my soul scythe...Being a reaper in training isn't easy but I really want to make father proude and all my ancester's before me. I smiled thinking about my family's haritage. My black wing's came out so I cleaned them. After washing up and drying off I came out to get dressed when dad knocked on my door. (Alexis)"Yes?" "I forgot I have a present for you." I opened the door I was just in my underwear. Dad handed me some earing's the where small scythes with a red gem in them. (Alexis)"What's these for?" "Their part of your training they'll make it so normal human's can't see your true form when your not in your form no one will be able to tell. I smiled as dad quickly placed them on my earlobe. My wing's vanished my eye's changed to normal human color. (Alexis)"This is so wierd..." Father kissed my forhead. "Please bare with it.Getting through this is also your training." I nodded. I know what he means all reaper's go to the human world for training. While we where talking I got dressed.
