Mother aren't you ready? "No Alexis not yet." I finished cooking breakfast while mom got ready for her first day of work today at the magic academy. "Alexis is your sister still in bed?" (Alexis)"She went ahead she said she wanted to check out the clubs before the ceremony." (Mother)"Are you joining a club?" (Alexis)"Ya..." (Mother)"I know it's hard." We sat down and started to eat. After eating I cleaned up and headed out on my way moms new boyfriend saw me and stopped. "Hey Alexis heading to school?" (Alexis)"Oh hi Damian ya first day." (Damian)"Want a ride?" (Mother)"Hey love." Damian gave us a lift. We headed off to school. (Mother)"Do you know who you're teacher is?" I looked at my papers. (Alexis)"Someone named professor raven..." (Damian)"Ah he's the best teacher though he's pretty advanced." (Alexis)"Do you know him?" (Damian)"ya he's an old friend.Where here have a good day you too." Mom kissed Damian. And I took off. There was a lot of people handing out flyers for their clubs. I met up with Kate. (Kate)" Hey sis I hope your ready for the ceremony.Each new students get's to show off their magic." I mumbled. We got to the arena sis and I got our seat's. They announced a spiecle treat for the newe student's we get to battle with magic and armors. (Kate)"Sis your up next." I sighed. everyone was whispering about me and my attitude. The teachers where watching as well including our mom. (Mother)"Alexis you better take it seriusly or no more swords!" The others looked comfuzed Kate was giggling. I chanted and a scythe appeared and I had black armor appear. "Is that all she can do?" "Man this is going to be over fast." (Mother)"I'm afraid she's not even taking it seriusly...Though I don't blame her I suppose." I took a deep breath as my apponet got ready in a blink of an eye I was behind him with my scythe at his throat. I looked at him. (Alexis)"I'd give up if I where you." "I..I give..." I swung my scythe over my shoulder and started to walk away... The boy grit his teeth and ran after me my scythe pulsed he stopped in fear. "Look's like your sister is still scarey as ever huh Kate?" She chuckled. (Kate)" Hey Jake I guase though she not as into it like she use to be." She sighed. (Jake)"I heard about that it's to bad though hear she might get back into it again theirs some pretty strong students here. Not like that light weight she fought.
