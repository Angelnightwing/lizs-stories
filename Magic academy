Mother aren't you ready? "No Alexis not yet." I finished cooking breakfast while mom got ready for her first day of work today at the magic academy. "Alexis is your sister still in bed?" (Alexis)"She went ahead she said she wanted to check out the clubs before the ceremony." (Mother)"Are you joining a club?" (Alexis)"Ya..." (Mother)"I know it's hard." We sat down and started to eat.
