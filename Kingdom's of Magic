I was cleaning the library when a huge sound from out side caught my attention...It was late at night.Wander what it could be....I caught one of the gaurds passing by. "Hey whats going on?" "An army broke through the first gates...Theirs no need to worry though." My tail flicked and my ears twiched. "If you'll exscuse me." He left...I looked out the window I could see torches outside but that was just a distraction...some where already at the castle.
