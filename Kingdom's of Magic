I was cleaning the library when a huge sound from out side caught my attention...It was late at night.Wander what it could be....I caught one of the gaurds passing by. "Hey whats going on?" "An army broke through the first gates...Theirs no need to worry though." My tail flicked and my ears twiched. "If you'll exscuse me." He left...I looked out the window I could see torches outside but that was just a distraction...some where already at the castle. I ran through the halls I hid behind one of the pillars inside the throne room. A fight broke outside than all of a sudden the doors swung open the knights went in front of the king and queen to protect them... "Why are you doing this?" A man wearing armor came in. "To rule these lands and conqer!" I better help them.... I was about to when all of a sudden I was knocked through the pillar than hitting the other side I coughed. "Ow!" I stood up my tail flicking back and forth my wings spread forth. (My lady time to return.) All of a sudden a huge dragon claw came out from behind me with chains wrapped around holding it out for me. "Alright..." I stepped onto his claw. "Wait help us please princess!" "
