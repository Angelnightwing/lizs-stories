Hey Professor I think we found something! "What is it?" An egg sir but it's huge nothing I've seen before. "Better call them ...And make sure no one goes near it."The family that owns this inland sir?" He nodded. The young man left in a hurry like the professor asked he went to the main family house.He explained what they found the man. "Really where?" A young boy looked down from the stairs. "At the ruins the proffesor asked me to tell you for some reasons the phones wouldn't work..." "I see Videric go get ready.Can you take us their right away?" The young man nodded He took them with him to the ruins the proffesor was waiting. "Ah proffesor did you find something?" (Proffesor)"Yes you might want to see for yourself....It hasn't reacted though..." The proffesor showed them the way down a long path way into the ruins when they got their black crystals surrounded a larg egg. While they talked the young boy started to walk up to the strange formation. "Wait kid you shouldn't get near it!" Everyone paniced exept the two men.(Videric) "It's alright." The boy said in a quiet tone the crystals stopped pulsing.(Videric) "That's it." He placed his hand on the egg it was hot than a heart beat was heard throughout the ruins. (Videric)"Aren't you lonely in their? Why don't you wake up? My names Videric." All of a sudden a mark appeared on his hand the mark of the family crest the egg started to crack as the whole place trembled. (Proffesor)"Valamir is that?" He nodded. (Valamir)"Looks like we found her Viderics sister." After the egg completly shattered a young girl fell out she had long black hair her eyes where like the night sky she looked up at the boy he carefully picked her up and carried her to his father.(Valamir)"Looks like she's bonded to you..." (Videric)"This time I'll protect her father I promise." (Valamir)"Good she'll need you let's take her back to the mansion." Years later....
